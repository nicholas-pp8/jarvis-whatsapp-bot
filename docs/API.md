# JARVIS API

The JARVIS API is the central layer for the ecosystem. The WhatsApp bot, a future pairing portal, the web dashboard and a mobile app all talk to it instead of touching the bot's files or database.

It is **off by default**. Set `API_PORT` to turn it on. It listens on `API_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`); put nginx with HTTPS in front to expose it.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `API_PORT` | Port to listen on. Unset means the API is off. |
| `API_HOST` | Bind address. Default `127.0.0.1`. |
| `API_JWT_SECRET` | Secret for 15 minute JWTs. Without it a random per-boot secret is used (tokens stop working after a restart). |
| `API_CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma separated list of browser origins allowed to call the API. Default: none. |

No secrets live in the code or the repo.

## Layout

```
src/api/
  server.js        http server, request pipeline (CORS, rate limit, body, auth, validation, errors)
  routes.js        route table: method, path, role, body schema, handler
  controllers.js   validates input, shapes the response
  services/        all real work: botService, sessionService, keys, jwt, webhooks
  middleware.js    auth, RBAC, rate limiter, CORS, validation, security headers
  openapi.js       OpenAPI 3 document generated from routes.js
  events/bus.js    in-process event bus used by webhooks
  logger.js        structured JSON logs with redaction
```

Rules: routes only map URLs, controllers never touch files or the database, services own the logic. To add an endpoint, add a service function, a controller function and one line in `routes.js`. The OpenAPI docs update themselves.

## Responses

Success: `{"success":true,"data":{...}}`. Error: `{"success":false,"error":{"code":"forbidden","message":"..."}}`. Every response has an `x-request-id` header.

## Authentication and roles

Roles, lowest to highest: `readonly`, `service`, `admin`, `owner`.

1. The owner creates a key in a private chat with the bot: `/apikey create <name> <role>`. The key is shown once and only its hash is stored. `/apikey list` and `/apikey revoke <id>` manage keys.
2. Send it as the `X-API-Key` header, or trade it for a 15 minute token: `POST /api/v1/auth/token` with the key header returns a Bearer JWT.
3. Each route lists its minimum role in the docs.

## Endpoints (v1)

| Method and path | Role | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET /health | none | Liveness |
| POST /auth/token | key | Trade a key for a JWT |
| GET /auth/me | readonly | Caller id and role |
| GET /bot/status | readonly | Online, connection, version, uptime |
| GET /bot/runtime | service | RAM, CPU, disk, command counters |
| POST /bot/restart | owner | Restart the process. Body `{"confirm":true}` |
| GET, POST /keys, DELETE /keys/:id | admin | Manage API keys |
| GET /sessions, GET /sessions/:id | service | WhatsApp session status (never credentials) |
| DELETE /sessions/:id | owner | Log the session out. Body `{"confirm":true}`. The number must be paired again. |
| POST /portal/otp | service | Send a 6-digit portal login code from the bot's own WhatsApp session. Fixed wording; 20 s limit per number. Body `{"number","code"}` |
| GET /pairing/capabilities | service | What pairing supports today |
| POST /pairing/requests | admin | Reserved for the pairing portal. Returns 501 now. |
| GET /events/types | readonly | Event names for webhooks |
| GET, POST /webhooks, DELETE /webhooks/:id, POST /webhooks/:id/test | admin | Manage webhooks |

Interactive docs: `/api/v1/docs` (Swagger UI). Raw spec: `/api/v1/openapi.json`.

## Webhooks

Create one with `POST /webhooks {"url":"https://...","events":["connection.changed"]}`. The signing secret is returned once. The URL must be HTTPS and must not resolve to a private, loopback or link-local address; this is checked again on every delivery.

Each delivery is a JSON POST with headers `x-jarvis-event`, `x-jarvis-timestamp` and `x-jarvis-signature`. The signature is `sha256=` plus the HMAC-SHA256 of `<timestamp>.<raw body>` using your secret. Reject deliveries whose timestamp is older than 5 minutes. A non-2xx answer is retried after 5 seconds, 30 seconds and 5 minutes, then dropped. Events: `connection.changed`, `session.revoked`, `bot.restart`, `webhook.test`.

## What the API never does

- It never returns WhatsApp credentials, session files, API keys or secrets. Session views show a masked account (`91********10`).
- There is no endpoint that runs code, shell commands or arbitrary file paths.
- Logs redact tokens, keys, numbers and JIDs.

## Commands, plugins and AI (milestone c)

| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | /commands, /commands/{name} | readonly | Command metadata: usage, level, enabled, `apiExecutable` |
| POST | /commands/{name}/execute | service | Run an API-safe command with `{"args":[...]}` |
| GET | /plugins | readonly | Feature groups, on/off, command counts |
| POST | /plugins/{name}/enable, /disable | admin | Same switch as `/settings`; emits `plugin.changed` |
| POST | /ai/chat | service | `{"prompt"}` through the bot's AI providers |
| POST | /ai/translate | service | `{"text","to"}` |

Execution is limited to a fixed allowlist of simple text commands (time, 8ball, coinflip, dice, fact, joke, quote, define, timestamp). They run with a stub context: no WhatsApp socket, no chat, no group or owner powers, a 10 second timeout, and the same "switched off by owner" check as chat. Anything else answers 403. There is no endpoint that runs code or shell commands.

AI calls use the keys already set for the bot (never returned). Each caller key gets `API_AI_PER_HOUR` calls per hour (default 30), shared by chat and translate.

## Telemetry (milestone d)

| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | /telemetry/ping | public | Install ping. Same strict schema as the legacy `/telemetry` route (hashed install id, version, uptime, command counts, optional number hash; unknown fields rejected). 404 unless this deployment sets `TELEMETRY_COLLECTOR=on` |
| GET | /telemetry/summary | service | Totals, versions, top commands and the SID list |

The legacy `/telemetry` path on the dashboard port stays as an alias, so already-installed bots keep working. Both paths feed the same collector. Behind a reverse proxy set `API_TRUST_PROXY=on` so the per-IP limit uses the real client address. The dashboard keeps its own token login and reads the collector directly; it does not need an API key.
